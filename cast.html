    <h2> Aaron "Hotch" Hotchner </h2> <p> Aaron Hotchner was a Supervisory Special Agent, Unit Chief, Direct Supervisor of all Special Agents in the Behavioral Analysis Unit, and Media Liaison Officer up until his resignation in Season 13. The last position was a job he took on in Season 7 folowing the promotion of JJ that he split with Penelope Garcia. Hotch is regarded by many as the father or otherwise leader of the BAU, both in universe and by the show's fanbase. He was married to Haley Hotchner but divorced in Season 3 after several struggles and arguments due to his dedication to his line of work. They had a single young son named Jack. Haley was murdered by George Foyet, a serial killer with a personal vendetta against Hotch, in 5x9, the hundredth episode of the show. In Season 12, Hotch left the BAU and entered witness protection with his son from serial killer Mr. Scratch. In Season 13, his resignation was made official so he could be a full-time father. In reality, actor Thomas Gibson was fired from the show after a slight altercation on set. </p>
    <p> Hotch is known to be a very serious, commanding person. He is stern and likes for things to be in order, not wasting time on loitering or making jokes. Despite this, he cares very strongly about he people he's close to, especially his son and his team. A prime example of his protectiveness is when he killed George Foyet with his bare hands after the murder of his ex-wife and attempted murder of his child.</p> <br>

    <h2> Derek Morgan </h2> <p> Derek Morgan was a Supervisory Special Agent of the FBI's Behavorial Analysis Unit who specialized in obsessional crimes and explosives up until his resignation in Season 11. He is one of few characters who stayed for the longest consecutive time in the series. He made his first appearance in the pilot episode of the show and had no breaks or temporary leaves until his official sign-off at the end of Season 11. Derek marries Dr. Savannah Hayes in Season 11 after meeting her in Season 9. He is kidnapped, tortured, and nearly killed before being saved by the BAU and returning home to his wife in labor. They have one son, Hank Spencer Morgan, named after Derek's late father Hank and bestfriend Spencer Reid. Despite resigning in Season 11 to focus on his new family and keep himself and them safe, Derek makes a few cameo appearances in Seasons 12 and 13 and is mentioned countless times after he leaves the FBI.</p>
    <p>Morgan is regarded as a very passionate person. He tends to engage in banter and make lighthearted jokes, teasing the young and awkward Spencer Reid in early seasons before their friendship blossomed. He's often called a playboy who was once said to have "never been seen with the same woman twice" by Reid. Aside from his extroverted and jovial personality, Morgan is incredibly serious and protective when it comes to his friends, his family, and whoever else he's taking care of. At times, he and Hotch disagreed on how to handle situations, but the two always managed to make up and compromise. Derek has a significant friendship with Penelope Garcia, his "god-given solace" and one of his closest friends alongside Spencer Reid.</p> <br>

     <h2> Emily Prentiss </h2> 
     <p> Emily Prentiss was a Supervisory Special Agent, and Unit Chief up until the end of Criminal Minds. She is the current FBI Section Chief in Criminal Minds: Evolution. She debuted in Season 2 to replace Elle Greenaway, briefly resigned in Season 3, faked her death in Season 6, left in Season 7, returned in Season 12, and was briefly suspended in Season 13. She is the character who has left and returned the most times. Emily debuted in 2x9 following the resignation of Elle, attempting to prove herself worthy as a member of the BAU. She begins her job as an official Agent of the BAU in 2x10. Prentiss resigned at the beginning of Season 3 but this lasted for not even a single episode as it was not deemed official due to Garcia's interference, and she returned in 3x2. In 6x18, she faked her death at the hands of Ian Doyle to prevent any further damage against the BAU. She returned and reunited with the team in Season 7, but left in the finale for a job in London working with Interpol. She briefly returns to save JJ in Season 9 and enlists the help of the BAU in Season 11. Emily voluntarily rejoins in Season 12 after Hotch's absence but is suspended by Linda Barnes in Season 13.</p>
    <p> Emily Prentiss is an incredibly smart, skilled agent. She is extremely level-headed and calm, rarely being caught off guard and maintaining a professional manner even in difficult situations. She easily got along well with the rest of the BAU despite being a new recruit and has a sarcastic sense of humor as well as being a good conversationalist. Emily was in a romantic relationship with Andrew Mendoza in the final seasons of Criminal Minds, but she is unmarried with no children as the current Section Chief in Seasons 16-17. </p> <br>
    <img class="garcia" width="300px" height="300px"src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/58/f8/12/58f8122d675c8411a2ffd5e726623864.jpg" alt="FBI Technical Analyst and Media Liaison Officer Penelope Garcia."> <br>
     <h2> Penelope Garcia </h2> 
     <p> Penelope Garcia is a Technical Analyst and Media Liaison Officer who resigned at the Season 15 show finale but returned to assist in the sequel Season 16 before officially rejoining the team. Garcia was absent in only one episode during the fifteen-year long, 324-episode series. This makes her the character with the most episodes and least absences as the rest of the cast either resigns early or leaves several times. Penelope Garcia was rarely ever on the frontlines as her job was to hack and provide information as well as direct the team in finding the suspects. She has only ever shot someone when a criminal undercover as a nurse tried to kill Reid in Season 9. In Season 3, she is shot by a man who takes her on a date. After being rushed to the hospital and saved, she meets another technical analyst who had helped save her, Kevin Lynch. They become romantically involved and Kevin a recurring character, but their relationship ends permanently in Season 7.</p>
    <p> Penelope Garcia is a bundle of joy. She dislikes violence and the gruesomeness of her career. She enjoys bright colors and cute things, decorating her desk at work with various items that help her disconnect from the brutal things she sees and finds. Garcia is an extreme empath who deeply loves and cares for her team, doing whatever she can to help them and consistently being crucial to solving cases. She is a happy soul who  sees the good in people, even being told by Hotch that he would never want her to change. Aside from JJ and Emily, Derek Morgan is her bestfriend, whom she calls her "Chocolate Thunder".</p> <br>

     <h2> Jennifer "JJ" Jareau </h2> 
     <p> Jennifer Jareau is the team's former Media Liaison Officer who was promoted to Supervisory Special Agent in Season 7. As a Media Liaison Officer, Jennifer Jareau handled many affairs for the team such as what to reveal to the media, who to connect with, and how to maintain an image and help profile unsubs. She meets New Orleans detective William LaMontagne in Season 2 and they begin dating, though this is only officially revealed in Season 3. It is revealed that she is pregnant with his child in the season finale, and she is briefly absent in Season 4 for maternity leave. She marries Will in the end of Season 7 and has another son, Michael, in Season 11.</p> 
     <p> Jennifer Jareau is a calm and sympathetic person. She is good at making conversation, soothing others, and is usually the one who breaks bad news to families of victims. She is friendly, a true companion to her team, extremely loyal, and well-liked. JJ is on the reserved side, having a tendency to keep things to herself. In Season 1, she went on a date with Spencer Reid, but their relationship ended up never going further than a close friendship. The godmother of her children is Penelope Garcia, the godfather Spencer Reid. </p> <br> 
    <img class="reid" width="300px" height="300px"src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/95/20/5d/95205db0861812537da70b8981562c61.jpg" alt="Supervisory Special Agent Spencer Reid."> 
     <h2> Spencer Reid </h2> 
     <p> Spencer Reid is a Supervisory Special Agent. He is a genius with an eidetic memory who is often crucial to the capturing of unsubs in the show. He has several college degrees, graduated highschool five years early, and is the youngest person to ever join the FBI at the age of 22. He comes from a troubled home, where his father left and he was forced to take care of his mentally ill mother since youth. He was in love with Maeve Donovan, but she was murdered in front of his eyes before they could truly pursue one another. In Season 2, he is held captive by a serial killer and injected with the drug Dilaudid; he later becomes addicted but manages to go sober. He was framed for murder in Mexico and went to prison in Season 12. After the event, his personality went through a drastic change.</p>
    <p> Spencer Reid is noted to be awkward and not the most socially adept. It is implied he has either autism or Asperger's syndrome. Being a bullying victim in his youth and different from his peers, Reid has little awareness of social cues. He struggles to empathize with others or feel many emotions. Reid also doesn't consistently get humor or sarcasm but has a better understanding throughout the series. He is a germophobe, very blunt, and has a tendency to ramble on or go on dumps of information given the massive amount of knowledge he holds. His bestfriend is his polar opposite Derek Morgan, and he is the godfather of both Derek's son (who was partially named after him) and JJ's two sons.</p> <br>
    <img class="rossi" width="300px" height="300px"src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/07/91/91/0791914c08aac85e38f0584685638783.jpg" alt="Supervisory Special Agent and Unit Senior Agent David Rossi."> 
    <h2> David Rossi </h2> 
    <p> David Rossi is a Supervisory Special Agent and Unit Senior Agent. He was a Marine who fought in the Vietnam War and worked up to the rank of Seargant Major. After being recruited to the FBI following his discharge from the Corps, he worked as partners alongside Jason "Best Profiler in the BAU" Gideon, and they founded the Behavorial Analysis Unit together. When his bestfriend resigned in Season 2, Rossi came out of retirement to replace him and work with the BAU once again. He was married and divorced several times with one children throughout all the marriages, Joy Struthers with Hayden Montgomery. </p> 
    <p> David Rossi is at first morally grey upon his introduction. He was reserved from the rest of the team for several cases until finally warming up to them. As he began to trust them and remember that he was here because Gideon couldn't be, Rossi grew to be extremely loyal to the group of agents. He has a sarcastic sense of humor similar to Emily Prentiss and a slight ego, but he doesn't let it get in the way of things. Rossi, like his bestfriend, is very bold and blunt with what he thinks and wants to say. He can be compassionate but is more on the stoic side, not letting himself be too affected by difficult circumstances, though he grieved when Jason Gideon and Erin Strauss passed away. </p>
