    <p class="home"> Criminal Minds is an American television show that aired on CBS from September 22nd, 2005 to February 19th, 2020. It ended as a 15-season show, but was renewed once in 2021 for a 16th sequel season and again in 2023 for a 17th. There were 324 original episodes and 337 including the sequel seasons. It is a crime drama following the story of FBI profilers who work in the Behavioral Analysis Unit, otherwise known as the BAU. Each episode features a distinct unknown subject, a serial killer or murderer that the agents seek to eliminate — not always working alone. On occasion, unsubs evade capture and survive without punishment, leading to several recurring antagonists and some who remain at large for the entire series. </p>
    <p class="home"> Balancing a demanding career, constant threats on their lives, and battling their own troubles at home, the main group of Criminal Minds is an exceptional team and formidable taskforce. Throughout 15 original seasons, the following members remained for the longest time and made up the heart of the BAU: Spencer Reid, David Rossi, Jennifer "JJ" Jareau, Emily Prentiss, Penelope Garcia, Derek Morgan, and Aaron Hotchner. Honorable mentions include Elle Greenaway and Jason Gideon, two characters who appeared at the very beginning of the show but both departed in Season 2 under unfortunate circumstances. It should be noted that Criminal Minds underwent several changes to the original cast throughout the years and the Season 1 ensemble is drastically different from the sequels.</p>
