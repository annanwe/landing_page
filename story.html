    <h2> At a Deeper Glance... </h2> <br>
    <h3> Juggling what is arguably one of the most difficult careers in the world with a home life isn't easy. Throughout the fifteen seasons of Criminal Minds, the main cast consistently fights their own battles when not out on the frontlines saving lives and catching serial killers. Here is a short description of each character's backstory, with a regular profile of them listed in the CAST section. </h3>
    <h2> Aaron Hotchner </h2>
    <p> Little is known about Hotch's childhood or teenage years, and most of his character's home life revolves around the struggles of his current family. Before he decided to become an FBI agent, he studied at college to be a prosecutor, switching to the BAU in order to make a larger difference. He married Haley Brooks and had his young son Jack Hotchner sometime before the beginning of the show. His absence at home becomes a recurring issue in his family and relationship with his wife, the tenacity of his career forcing him to spend more time working than Haley would like. It is briefly implied Haley was unfaithful, but this is not elaborated on. They divorce in Season 3 and later go into Witness Protection from murderer George Foyet. Following Haley's murder and the attempted of Jack in Season 5, Hotch kills Foyet for good. The rest of the series follows his struggles as a single father, and despite briefly having another love interest, he does not remarry and leaves the BAU to commit to his son by Seasons 12 and 13. </p> 
    <h2> Derek Morgan </h2>
    <p> Derek Morgan grew up in an urban Chicago neighborhood with his parents, two sisters, and his aunt. His father was a police officer, shot dead in front of Derek when he was only 10 years old, causing him to act out and become a delinquent. He got in fights often and had a criminal record as a juvenile. Derek was taken in by youth leader Carl Buford, who helped him begin to turn his life around, aided in landing him a college football scholarship, and erased his criminal record. However, Carl was secretly abusing Derek, something that he did not reveal to others and come to terms with until years into his adult life and career (Seasons 2 and 8). Derek graduated University, acquired a Law degree, and was part of the Chicago police force (like his father) alongside several other feats before becoming an FBI agent. He later settles down, marrying Dr. Savannah Hayes and having a son named Hank Spencer Morgan, prompting him to resign from the FBI in Season 11.</p> 
    <h2> Emily Prentiss </h2>
    <p> Emily Prentiss, like Hotch, has little about her youth discussed in the series. Her father is scarcely mentioned and her mother is a diplomat, leading them to travel around the world often. Emily had a strained relationship with her mom. When she was a teenager and in Rome for her mother's business affairs, she got pregnant and had an abortion that caused more stress and tension in her life. She graduated from two colleges, one of them being Yale, and she earned her Bachelor's in Criminal Justice. She had a fake identity, Lauren Reynolds, that she used to gain the trust of serial killer Ian Doyle, a crucial part of her background. Emily never marries in the show, has no children, and few love interests.</p> 
    <h2> Penelope Garcia </h2>
    <p> Penelope Garcia's parents were hit by a drunk driver and died when she was eighteen. They had been out looking for her when she stayed out past curfew. Following their death, Garcia dropped out of CalTech and went off the grid, teaching herself coding and computer science. She went on to become an extremely skilled hacker and technician, gathering the attention of the FBI who placed her on a list of dangerous hackers. She used to dress in all-black attire. Garcia was captured by the FBI and given the choice to either become their Technical Analyst, or serve jailtime. She chose to do something good with her skills, was recruited into the BAU, and switched her style to bright and happy. Penelope is the longest running character in the show, and she does not marry or have children.</p> 
    <h2> Jennifer Jareau </h2>
    <p> Jennifer Jareau has perhaps one of the most extensive stories in the cast. She grew up in a small town with at least two siblings, one of them being her older sister Roslyn, who committed suicide when JJ was 11 years old. JJ was the one who found her body and was scarred by the event. She earned a soccer scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh and later attended Georgetown University, where she listened to a lecture by David Rossi and became inspired to join the FBI. She has a very brief romantic connection to Spencer Reid, begins dating police detective William LaMontagne in Season 2, has a son Henry in Season 4, marries Will in Season 7's finale, and has a second son Michael in Season 11. She is forced to take a job at the Pentagon in Season 6 but returns to the BAU. JJ was revealed in Season 9 to have had a miscarriage during her time at the Pentagon with what would have been her and Will's second child. </p> 
    <h2> Spencer Reid </h2>
    <p> Spencer Reid's father walked out on him and his schizophrenic mother when he was young. Reid is a genius with an eidetic memory who absorbed lots of knowledge from reading books, encouraged by his mother who was a college professor of literature before her illness took over. He graduated highschool when he was only 12 years old and was a victim of bullying for his intelligence and social awkwardness. He sent his mother to a mental institution when he was 18 and kept her there until Season 12. Reid has 3 Doctorate degrees in Mathematics, Chemistry, Engineering and Bachelors in Psychology, Sociology, and Philosophy. He joined the FBI when he was 22. He has one major love interest in the entire story, Maeve Donovan, who is murdered in front of him. JJ is a close second, but their relationship is shortlived and does not go anywhere. </p> 
    <h2> David Rossi </h2>
    <p> David Rossi is the oldest member of the BAU. He was a Marine and fought in the Vietnam War, earning countless awards and later reaching the rank of Seargant Major. He was recruited by the FBI after leaving the Marine Corps and helped create the BAU unit alongside Jason Gideon. He has been married (and divorced) three times to Carolyn, Hayden, and Krystall. He had one child each with the first two, though his son with Carolyn passed away the same day he was born. He has a single living child, his daughter with Hayden, Joy Struthers. He was retired in the late 90s but returned to the BAU following the departure of Jason Gideon. He had a romantic relationship with Section Chief Erin Strauss and was visibly upset by her death in Season 8. He is currently unmarried and widowed.</p>
